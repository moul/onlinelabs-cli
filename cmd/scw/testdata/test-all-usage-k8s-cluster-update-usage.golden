Update a specific Kubernetes cluster. Note that this method is designed to update details such as name, description, tags and configuration. However, you cannot upgrade a cluster with this method. To do so, use the dedicated endpoint.

USAGE:
  scw k8s cluster update <cluster-id ...> [arg=value ...]

EXAMPLES:
  Enable dashboard on a cluster
    scw k8s cluster update 11111111-1111-1111-111111111111 enable-dashboard=true

  Add TTLAfterFinished and ServiceNodeExclusion as feature gates on a cluster
    scw k8s cluster update 11111111-1111-1111-111111111111 feature-gates.0=TTLAfterFinished feature-gates.1=ServiceNodeExclusion
