Server types are denomination of the different instances we provide.
Scaleway offers **Virtual Cloud** and **dedicated GPU** instances.

**Virtual Cloud Instances**

Virtual cloud instances are offering the best performance/price ratio for most workloads.
Different instance ranges are proposed:

* The **Development** instances range provides stable and consistent performance for
  development and testing needs. Spin up a development or test environment within seconds.
  Refer to the [Development Instance offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/play2/)
  for more information.

* The **General Purpose** instances range is the solution for production workloads. Powerful
  AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and offer up to 48 Cores, 256GB of RAM and storage
  options up to 600GB of replicated local NVMe SSD storage and/or up to 10TB of Block Storage.
  Refer to the [General Purpose offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/pro2/) for more information.

* The **Enterprise** instances range is the solution for most demanding workloads and
  mission-critical applications. Powerful AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and
  offer up to 96 Cores, 384GB of RAM and up to 10TB of Block Storage. Refer to the
  [Enterprise offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/enterprise/) for more information.

**Dedicated GPU Instances**

Scaleway GPU Instances are virtual compute instances equipped with dedicated high-end
Nvidia graphical processing unit (GPUs). They are ideal for data processing, artificial
intelligence, rendering and video encoding. The GPU is dedicated to each instance and
directly exposed through PCI-e. For more information, refer to the
[GPU Instances Developper Documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/gpu/quickstart/).
