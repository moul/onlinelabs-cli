Deletes the given resource ID and pins the new CID in its place.
Will fetch and store the content pointed by the provided CID. The content must be available on the public IPFS network.
The content (IPFS blocks) is hosted by the pinning service until the pin is deleted.
While the content is available any other IPFS peer can fetch and host your content. For this reason, we recommend that you pin either public or encrypted content.
Several different pin requests can target the same CID.
A pin is defined by its ID (UUID), its status (queued, pinning, pinned or failed) and target CID.
