Snapshots contain the data of a specified volume at a particular point in time.
The data can include the Instance's operating system,
configuration information and/or files stored on the volume.

A snapshot can be done from a specified volume, e.g. you
have one Instance with a volume containing the OS and another one
containing the application data, and you want to use different
snapshot strategies on both volumes.

A snapshot's volume type can be either its original volume's type
(`l_ssd` or `b_ssd`) or `unified`. Similarly, volumes can be created as well from snapshots
of their own type or `unified`. Therefore, to migrate data from a `l_ssd` volume
to a `b_ssd` volume, one can create a `unified` snapshot from the original volume
and a new `b_ssd` volume from this snapshot. The newly created volume will hold a copy
of the data of the original volume.
