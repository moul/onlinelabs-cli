A security group is a set of firewall rules on a set of instances.
Security groups enable to create rules that either drop or allow incoming traffic from certain ports of your instances.

Security Groups are stateful by default which means return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules.
As a contrary, you have to switch in a stateless mode to define explicitly allowed.
