Generate a new data encryption key to use for cryptographic operations outside of Key Manager. Note that Key Manager does not store your data encryption key. The data encryption key is encrypted and must be decrypted using the key you have created in Key Manager. The data encryption key's plaintext is returned in the response object, for immediate usage.

Always store the data encryption key's ciphertext, rather than its plaintext, which must not be stored. To retrieve your key's plaintext, call the Decrypt endpoint with your key's ID and ciphertext.

USAGE:
  scw keymanager key generate-data-key [arg=value ...]

ARGS:
  key-id                ID of the key
  [algorithm]           Symmetric encryption algorithm of the data encryption key (unknown_symmetric_encryption | aes_256_gcm)
  [without-plaintext]   (Optional) Defines whether to return the data encryption key's plaintext in the response object
  [region=fr-par]       Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config (fr-par | nl-ams | pl-waw)

FLAGS:
  -h, --help   help for generate-data-key

GLOBAL FLAGS:
  -c, --config string    The path to the config file
  -D, --debug            Enable debug mode
  -o, --output string    Output format: json or human, see 'scw help output' for more info (default "human")
  -p, --profile string   The config profile to use
