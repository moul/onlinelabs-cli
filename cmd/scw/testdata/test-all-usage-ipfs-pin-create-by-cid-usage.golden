Will fetch and store the content pointed by the provided CID. The content must be available on the public IPFS network.
The content (IPFS blocks) will be host by the pinning service until pin deletion.
From that point, any other IPFS peer can fetch and host your content: Make sure to pin public or encrypted content.
Many pin requests (from different users) can target the same CID.
A pin is defined by its ID (UUID), its status (queued, pinning, pinned or failed) and target CID.
