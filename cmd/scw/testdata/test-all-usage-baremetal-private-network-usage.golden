A private network allows interconnecting your resources
(servers, instances, ...) in an isolated and private
network. The network reachability is limited to the
resources that are on the same private network.  A VLAN
interface is available on the server and can be freely
managed (adding IP addresses, shutdown interface...).

Note that a resource can be a part of multiple private networks.
