## Flexible IP management commands

A flexible IP can be attached to any Elastic Metal server within the same zone.
Multiple flexible IPs can be attached to a server.

```
scw fip ip attach [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| fips-ids.{index} | Required | List of flexible IP IDs to attach to a server |
| server-id | Required | ID of the server on which to attach the flexible IPs |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `fr-par-2`, `nl-ams-1` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### Create a new flexible IP

Generate a new flexible IP within a given zone, specifying its configuration including Project ID and description.

**Usage:**

```
scw fip ip create [arg=value ...]
```
