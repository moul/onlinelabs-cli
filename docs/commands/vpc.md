## Private network management command

A Private Network allows you to interconnect your Scaleway resources
in an isolated and private network. Network reachability is limited
to resources that are on the same Private Network. Note that a
resource can be a part of multiple private networks.


### Create a Private Network

Create a new Private Network. Once created, you can attach Scaleway resources which are in the same region.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network create [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| name | Required<br />Default: `<generated>` | Name for the Private Network |
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| tags.{index} |  | Tags for the Private Network |
| subnets.{index} |  | Private Network subnets CIDR |
| vpc-id |  | VPC in which to create the Private Network |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Delete a Private Network

Delete an existing Private Network. Note that you must first detach all resources from the network, in order to delete it.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network delete <private-network-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| private-network-id | Required | Private Network ID |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Enable DHCP on a Private Network

Enable DHCP managed on an existing Private Network. Note that you will not be able to deactivate it afterwards.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network enable-dhcp [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| private-network-id | Required | Private Network ID |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Get a Private Network

Retrieve information about an existing Private Network, specified by its Private Network ID. Its full details are returned in the response object.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network get <private-network-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| private-network-id | Required | Private Network ID |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### List Private Networks

List existing Private Networks in the specified region. By default, the Private Networks returned in the list are ordered by creation date in ascending order, though this can be modified via the order_by field.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network list [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| order-by | One of: `created_at_asc`, `created_at_desc`, `name_asc`, `name_desc` | Sort order of the returned Private Networks |
| name |  | Name to filter for. Only Private Networks with names containing this string will be returned |
| tags.{index} |  | Tags to filter for. Only Private Networks with one or more matching tags will be returned |
| project-id |  | Project ID to filter for. Only Private Networks belonging to this Project will be returned |
| private-network-ids.{index} |  | Private Network IDs to filter for. Only Private Networks with one of these IDs will be returned |
| vpc-id |  | VPC ID to filter for. Only Private Networks belonging to this VPC will be returned |
| dhcp-enabled |  | DHCP status to filter for. When true, only Private Networks with managed DHCP enabled will be returned |
| organization-id |  | Organization ID to filter for. Only Private Networks belonging to this Organization will be returned |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw`, `all` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Migrate Private Networks from zoned to regional

Transform multiple existing zoned Private Networks (scoped to a single Availability Zone) into regional Private Networks, scoped to an entire region. You can transform one or many Private Networks (specified by their Private Network IDs) within a single Scaleway Organization or Project, with the same call.

**Usage:**

```
scw vpc private-network migrate-to-regional <private-network-ids.{index} ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| project-id |  | Project ID to use. If none is passed the default project ID will be used |
| private-network-ids.{index} | Required | IDs of the Private Networks to migrate |
| organization-id |  | Organization ID to use. If none is passed the default organization ID will be used |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams`, `pl-waw` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |



### Update Private Network
