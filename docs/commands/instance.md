## Image management commands

Images are backups of your instances.
You can reuse that image to restore your data or create a series of instances with a predefined configuration.

An image is a complete backup of your server including all volumes.

## Placement group management commands

Placement groups allow the user to express a preference regarding
the physical position of a group of instances. It'll let the user
choose to either group instances on the same physical hardware for
best network throughput and low latency or to spread instances on
far away hardware to reduce the risk of physical failure.

The operating mode is selected by a `policy_type`. Two policy
types are available:
  - `low_latency` will group instances on the same hypervisors
  - `max_availability` will spread instances on far away hypervisors

The `policy_type` is set by default to `max_availability`.

For each policy types, one of the two `policy_mode` may be selected:
  - `optional` will start your instances even if the constraint is not respected
  - `enforced` guarantee that if the instance starts, the constraint is respected

The `policy_mode` is set by default to `optional`.

## Server management commands

Server types are denomination of the different instances we provide.
Scaleway offers **Virtual Cloud** and **dedicated GPU** instances.

**Virtual Cloud Instances**

Virtual cloud instances are offering the best performance/price ratio for most workloads. Different CPU architectures are proposed: The **Development** and **General Purpose** ranges are based on AMD EPYC CPUs. The **ARM64** range is based on Cavium Thunder X ARM CPUs.

* The **Development** instances range provides stable and consistent performance for development needs.
  Spin up a development or test environment within seconds.
  Refer to the [Development Instance offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/development-instances/) for more information.

* The **General Purpose** instances range is the solution for demanding workloads.
  Powerful AMD EPYC CPUs back those instances and offer up to 48 Cores, 256GB of RAM and 600GB of replicated local NVMe SSD storage.
  Refer to the [General Purpose offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/general-purpose-instances/) for more information.

* The **ARM** instances range is based on Cavium ThunderX SoCs and provides up to 64 Cores ARM 64bit, 128GB of RAM and 1TB SSD storage.
  Refer to the [ARM offer details](https://www.scaleway.com/en/arm-instances) for more information.

**Dedicated GPU Instances**

GPU instances are very powerful compute instances, providing lots of RAM, vCPU, and storage.

They are equipped with Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs, which are designed for handling rapidly, a massive amount of data.
They are useful for heavy data processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, video encoding, rendering, and so on.
The GPU is dedicated to each instance and directly exposed through PCI-e.
For more information, refer to [GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/).

## User data management commands

User data is a key value store API you can use to provide data from and to your server without authentication.

As an example of use, Scaleway images contain the script scw-generate-ssh-keys which generates SSH server’s host keys then stores their fingerprints as user data under the key “ssh-host-fingerprints”.
This way, we ensure they are really connecting to their Scaleway instance and they are not victim of a man-in-the-middle attack.

There are two endpoints to access user data:
 - **From a running instance**, by using the metadata API at http://169.254.42.42/user_data.
   To enhance security, we only allow user data viewing and editing as root.
   To know if the query is issued by the root user, we only accept queries made from a local port below 1024 (by default, non-root users can’t bind ports below 1024).
   To specify the local port with cURL, use `curl --local-port 1-1024 http://169.254.42.42/user_data`
 - **From the instance API** at using methods described bellow.

## Volume management commands

A volume is where you store your data inside your instance. It
appears as a block device on Linux that you can use to create
a filesystem and mount it.

We have two different types of volume (`volume_type`):
  - `l_ssd` is a local block storage: your data is downloaded on
    the hypervisor and you need to power off your instance to attach
    or detach a volume.
  - `b_ssd` is a remote block storage: your data is stored on a
    centralised cluster. You can plug and unplug a volume while
    your instance is running. As of today, `b_ssd` is only available
    for `DEV1`, `GP1` and `RENDER` offers.

Minimum and maximum volume sizes for each volume types can be queried
from the zone `/products/volumes` API endpoint. _I.e_ for:
  - `fr-par-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/fr-par-1/products/volumes
  - `nl-ams-1`  use https://api.scaleway.com/instance/v1/zones/nl-ams-1/products/volumes

Each types of volumes is also subject to a global quota for the sum of all the
volumes. This quota depends of the level of support and may be
changed on demand.

Be wary that when terminating an instance, if you want to keep
your block storage volume, **you must** detach it beforehand you
issue the `terminate` call.

When using multiple block devices, it's advised to mount them by
using their UUID instead of their device name. A device name is
subject to change depending on the volumes order. Block devices
UUIDs can be found in `/dev/disk/by-id/`.



### Create a volume

**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|

| base-volume |  | The ID of the volume on which this volume will be based |
| base-snapshot |  | The ID of the snapshot on which this volume will be based |
| organization-id |  | Organization ID to use. If none is passed the default organization ID will be used |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-1`, `nl-ams-1` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |


**Examples:**


Create a volume called 'my-volume'
```
scw instance volume create name=my-volume
```

Create a volume with a size of 50GB
```
scw instance volume create size=50GB

```
scw instance volume update 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 name=a-new-name size=70GB
```




## Volume type management commands

Volume types will answer with all volume types available in a given zone.
Each of these types will contains all the capabilities and constraints of the volume (min size, max size, snapshot).

```
scw instance volume-type list [arg=value ...]
