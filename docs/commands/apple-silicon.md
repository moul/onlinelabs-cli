|------|---|-------------|
| server-id | Required | UUID of the server you want to get |
| zone | Default: `fr-par-1`<br />One of: `fr-par-3` | Zone to target. If none is passed will use default zone from the config |



### List all servers

List all servers in the specified zone. By default, returned servers in the list are ordered by creation date in ascending order, though this can be modified via the `order_by` field.
