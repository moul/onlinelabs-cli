### Reboot a node in a cluster

This method allows to reboot a specific node. This node will frist be cordoned, meaning that scheduling will be disabled. Then the existing pods on the node will be drained and reschedule onto another schedulable node.

This method allows to replace a specific node. The node will be set cordoned, meaning that scheduling will be disabled. Then the existing pods on the node will be drained and reschedule onto another schedulable node. Then the node will be deleted, and a new one will be created after the deletion. Note that when there is not enough space to reschedule all the pods (in a one node cluster for instance), you may experience some disruption of your applications.

**Usage:**

```
scw k8s node replace <node-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|

Wait for a node to reach a stable state. This is similar to using --wait flag on other action commands, but without requiring a new action on the node.

**Usage:**

```
scw k8s node wait <node-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| node-id | Required | ID of the node. |

## Kapsule pool management commands

A pool is a set of identical Nodes. A pool has a name, a size (its current number of nodes), nodes number limits (min, max) and a Scaleway instance type.
Changing those limits increases/decreases the size of a pool. Thus, when autoscaling is enabled, the pool will grow or shrink inside those limits, depending on its load.
A "default pool" is automatically created with every cluster.

### Update a pool in a cluster

This method allows to update some attributes of a specific pool such as the size, the autoscaling enablement, the tags, ...

**Usage:**

```

```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| pool-id | Required | The ID of the pool to update |
| autoscaling |  | The new value for the enablement of autoscaling for the pool |
| size |  | The new size for the pool |
| min-size |  | The new minimun size for the pool |
| max-size |  | The new maximum size for the pool |

```




### Upgrade a pool in a cluster

This method allows to upgrade the Kubernetes version of a specific pool. Note that this will work when the targeted version is the same than the version of the cluster.

**Usage:**

```
scw k8s pool upgrade <pool-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| pool-id | Required | The ID of the pool to upgrade |
| version | Required | The new Kubernetes version for the pool |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |


**Examples:**


Upgrade a given pool to the Kubernetes version 1.17.4
```
scw k8s pool upgrade 11111111-1111-1111-111111111111 version=1.17.4
```




### Wait for a pool to reach a stable state

Wait for a pool to reach a stable state. This is similar to using --wait flag on other action commands, but without requiring a new action on the node.

**Usage:**

```
scw k8s pool wait <pool-id ...> [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| pool-id | Required | ID of the pool. |
| region | Default: `fr-par` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |


**Examples:**


Wait for a pool to reach a stable state
```
scw k8s pool wait 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```




## Available Kubernetes version commands

A version is a vanilla Kubernetes version like `x.y.z`.
It is composed of a major version x, a minor version y and a patch version z.
Scaleway's managed Kubernetes, Kapsule, will at least support the last patch version for the last three minor release.

Also each version have a different set of container runtimes, CNIs, ingresses, feature gates and admission plugins available.



### Get details about a specific version

This method allows to get a specific Kubernetes version and the details about the version.

**Usage:**

```

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| version-name | Required | The requested version name |
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |


**Examples:**


Get the Kubernetes version 1.18.0
```
scw k8s version get 1.18.0
```




### List all available versions

This method allows to list all available versions for the creation of a new Kubernetes cluster.

**Usage:**

```
scw k8s version list [arg=value ...]
```


**Args:**

| Name |   | Description |
|------|---|-------------|
| region | Default: `fr-par`<br />One of: `fr-par`, `nl-ams` | Region to target. If none is passed will use default region from the config |
