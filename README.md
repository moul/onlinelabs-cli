# Scaleway CLI (v2)

Scaleway CLI is a tool to help you pilot your Scaleway infrastructure directly from your terminal.

# Installation

## With a Package Manager (Recommended)

A package manager installs and upgrades the Scaleway CLI with a single command.
We recommend this installation mode for more simplicity and reliability:

### Homebrew

Install the latest stable release on macOS using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install scw
```

### Arch Linux

Install the latest stable release on Arch Linux from [official repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/scaleway-cli/).
For instance with `pacman`:

```sh
pacman -S scaleway-cli
```

### Chocolatey

Install the latest stable release on Windows using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) ([Package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/scaleway-cli)):

```powershell
choco install scaleway-cli
```

## Manually

### Released Binaries

We provide [static-compiled binaries](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/latest) for darwin (macOS), GNU/Linux, and Windows platforms.
You just have to download the binary compatible with your platform to a directory available in your `PATH`:

#### Linux

```bash
# Check out the latest release available on github <https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/latest>
VERSION="2.5.4"

# Download the release from github
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/scw -L "https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/download/v${VERSION}/scaleway-cli_${VERSION}_linux_amd64"
# Naming changed lately, the url prior to 2.5.4 was https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/download/v${VERSION}/scw-${VERSION}-linux-x86_64

# Allow executing file as program
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scw

# Init the CLI
scw init
```

#### Windows

You can download the last release here: <https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases><br/>
[This official guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574%28v%3Doffice.14%29) explains how to add tools to your `PATH`.

## Docker Image

You can use the CLI as you would run any Docker image:

```sh
docker run -i --rm scaleway/cli:latest
```

See more in-depth information about running the CLI in Docker [here](./docs/docker.md)

# Getting Started

## Setup your configuration

After you [installed](#Installation) the latest release just run the initialization command and let yourself be guided! :dancer:

```bash
scw init
```

It will set up your profile, the authentication, and the auto-completion.

## Basic commands

```
# Create an instance server
scw instance server create type=DEV1-S image=ubuntu_focal zone=fr-par-1 tags.0="scw-cli"

# List your servers
scw instance server list

# Create a Kubernetes cluster named foo with cilium as CNI, in version 1.17.4 and with a pool named default composed of 3 DEV1-M and with 2 tags
scw k8s cluster create name=foo version=1.17.4 pools.0.size=3 pools.0.node-type=DEV1-M pools.0.name=default tags.0=tag1 tags.1=tag2
```

## Environment

You can configure your config or enable functionalities with environment variables.

Variables to override config are describe in [config documentation](docs/commands/config.md).
To enable beta features, you can set `SCW_ENABLE_BETA=1` in your environment.

## Build it yourself

### Build Locally

If you have a >= Go 1.13 environment, you can install the `HEAD` version to test the latest features or to [contribute](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Note that this development version could include bugs, use [tagged releases](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/releases/latest) if you need stability.

```bash
go install github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/v2/cmd/scw@latest
```

Dependencies: We only use go [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) with vendoring.

### Build with Docker

You can build the `scw` CLI with Docker. If you have Docker installed, you can run:

```sh
docker build -t scaleway/cli .
```

Once build, you can then use the CLI as you would run any image:

```sh
docker run -i --rm scaleway/cli
```

See more in-depth information about running the CLI in Docker [here](./docs/docker.md)
